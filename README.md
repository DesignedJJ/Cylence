# Cylence


Cylence is an endâ€‘toâ€‘end encrypted messaging application that aims to bring uncompromising privacy to everyday conversationsâ€¯â€”â€¯without sacrificing simplicity or style.

Why Cylence?

Total privacy by default â€“ messages are sealed the moment you hit send so only you and your recipient can ever see them.

All your devices â€“ desktop, mobile and the web. Start a chat on one device and seamlessly pick it up on another.

Modern, elegant UI â€“ designed to feel instantly familiar to nonâ€‘technical users while still packing powerâ€‘features for pros.

Open & transparent â€“ our code will be fully openâ€‘sourced so anyone can inspect, audit and help improve security.
